This is a project for being able to learn deeper about go `all that my mentors did not teach me` ;-)

The server functionality will be to stream positions of X players and process their commands.

This project aims to be a server with two possibilities. Run as an UDP server and as a TCP one for being able to test how *go* works in realtime server connections.
